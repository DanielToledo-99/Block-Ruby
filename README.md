# Instructions

Today's assignment consists of 5 ruby exercises. Each exercise has its own
directory:

- 12my_map
- 13my_all
- 14my_any
- 15my_select
- 16my_find

Inside each directory are 3 files: `exercise_name.rb`, `exercise_name_test.rb`
and `instructions.md`.

Following the instructions, you need to modify the file `exercise_name.rb` so
the tests will pass.
